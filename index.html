            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I am currently a sophomore in Columbia University and have completed coursework in Astrophysics, Statistics, Computer Science, and Philosophy. I enjoy learning about ideas and opportunities that are off the beaten track, and spend my free time reading about real estate and software development. Together with my 2 younger brothers, I'm currently working on EHR technology.
